# Final_Project
This is our final project. This long road lead us to this final destination, so lets make it count.

UPDATE:
That project was extremely hard! Learning how to use Unity was probably harder than learning Python but we made it... Especially the enemy AI that was difficult, as the layerMasking was confusing and it took a lot of videos to learn how to properly make it function. We added all the custom made and other scripts we used to create it, but most was built in so we didn't have much to add. If there is any problems please contact Donavan Jones! Once again thank you for this amazing experience
