# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

RUN FROM DONNIMO!!!

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It will be a parkour video game where your main object will be to escape and eventually turn the tide and defeat the creature/monster.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our game will allow the user to run, walk, and parkour around an area we will design while trying to escape from a creature/monster that moves slightly faster than the player. Using Unity, we will program an environment that forces the player to use the movement mechanics we plan to implement to reach an objective that would make the player "safe" from the creature. We plan on using  C# as that (we believe) is the program used for the Unity engine. We are still planning addition features, however we are not trying to make it too complicated as this is a brand new language.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NO

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will get down the walking, running, jumping, and basic environment.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Everything above in additon to adding a basic monster, sounds and perhaps a win screen.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We fully implement what is stated above with a detailed environment, checkpoints, realistic movement (such as player bobbing when running, detailed creature/ monster, and music!

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First, we will need to learn the basics of C# which will most likely be the most difficult part of the project. However, with prior coding experience with Python in additon to teamwork this is totally attainable within the timeframe. We will most likely use some type of tutorial video so we will not be totally lost be we still want to try a lot on our own if we can. We are planning to get the movement features working together then split the work between the three of us. One person will do terrain, the other working on sound (including possible creation of our own music), and the last person will work on the monster and other misc. things. We are very excited to begin working on this, with plenty of ideas shooting back and forth between each other and we agree that some features will likely be lost or added so we are ready for this project to shfit and evolve.
